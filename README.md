# NowLiveDoubleWebhookDemo
A demo of a feature request for the popular NowLive discord bot

This is a demo of using Webhooks to both interact with the Discord API and the Twitch API for the NowLive bot.
Each announcement should take around 5 minutes to announce, which can be either slower or faster than the current NowLive system, but more importantly it is consistent. It should scale the same whether it's announcing 1 stream per hour or 15 streams per second.
